# Adjust colors here
# Set this different on each server
# see file etc/.bash_colours for color chart reference
# e.g. my_under@my_host or through screen (tmux, etc) my_base@my_screen-host
# By Default, try to use the following as a guideline, customizing from there
# e.g. Even when your in screen, unless this is actually the host your
#    running screen on, you need to use the "MY_HOST" var to adjust the PS1
#    host color.
