# No need to adjust anything below normally. 
#
# Adjust PS1 below for one of two scenarios below. (Choose A if your not 
#   sure, choose B for a more proper setup, if your using screen on it) 
#
# For a jump host that you use screen in, the bold is the nicer output, hence why 
# it is used on the screen (else) portion of the following condntion. 
# This helps you notice if you've actually made your last screen yet, by being
# underlined still. 
#
# To adjust correctly; If this is your end destination then you only need your
# nice color.  i.e. comment the conditional below in favor of just having
# one PS1 entry everytime you land here, no matter screened or not.
#
# Choose an option below, comment out the other Option's usage altogether.
#
# a) Option A, Always use best color
# no editing needed
# PS1=$SCREEN_BASE$CURRENT_LOCATION$IBlack$BRANCH$PROMPT$TEXT

# b) Option B, Use the non screen color firs,t then when screened use the screen color. 
# Always run 'screen -RA', or screen-RAD if your wanting to detach it first incase you
# have switched consoles. The -R switch is key to keeping any alignment you may have
# had on the screen splits, through a jump, prior to disconnect, when using split 
# vertical screens
