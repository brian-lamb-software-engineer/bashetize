    # Multiplexing configuration
    #
    # Enable multiplexing globally
    #ControlMaster          auto
    #
    # set the path for the multiplex socket.  If you dont create a subdir, just use the ~/.ssh/%r... one. 
    # # Its normal to use a cm_socket dir for this, you can change the path here, add that dir, then update its permissions `chmod 700 ~/.ssh/cm_socket`.
    #ControlPath            ~/.ssh/cm_socket/%r@%h:%p
    ControlPath             ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p
    #
    # Multiplex setings (Set ControlMaster auto, on your individual host entry's below, to enable)
    ControlPersist          16h
    
    ##
    # ServerAlive (keep ssh sessions open so they dont disconnect, sometimes needs fine tuning)   
    ServerAliveInterval    120
    ServerAliveCountMax    240

    ##
    # TCPKeepAlive,  ALTERNATE to ServerAlive.  
    #  If above doesnt work on your server (above should work better)
    #  Sends a TCP ACK packet, firewalls might be configured to ignore these
    #TCPKeepAlive          yes
   
    ##
    # Identity File.  Specify your global personal key here
    ## TODO - Make sure to specify your correct most used keyfile here (if its named other than id_rsa).

# Host Configs:
# Place all your individual hosts that you connect to here (use examples at the bottom)



##
# EXAMPLES BELOW
#

##
# Example 1 (most common use)
# Host hostalias
#   Hostname serverhostname-or-ipaddress
#   ControlMaster auto

##
# Example 2 (Git connection) 
# Host git
#    Hostname               github.com
#    Port                   22
#    User		                git
#    IdentityFile           ~/.ssh/my_git_rsa
#    # set the interval back to default of 0, if you dont want to use the keep alive
#    ServerAliveInteravl    0

##
# Example 3 (multiple alias, and using multiplexing)
# # you should use if you connect frequently or across multiple terminals. 
# Host example3 another-example-alias3 yet-another-alias-example3
#    User		              myusername
#    Hostname             example.com
#    Port                 22
#    ControlMaster        auto
#    ControlPersist       16h
#    # options to try to stop the disconnect on connect issue
#    ServerAliveInterval  600
#    ServerAliveCountMax  48

##
# Example 4 (alternate port, alternate ControlPersist setting)
# Host e4
#    Hostname            123.45.67.89 
#    User                myusername
#    Port	               39901
#    ControlMaster       auto
#    ControlPersist      16h
#    IdentityFile        ~/.ssh/my_key


## 
# Other host directives examples
#
# Using an example host for this
#   Hostname            123.45.67.89
#
#   ##
#   # Example (SSH Agent Forwarding)
#   # Enable forwarding (yes or no)
#   #  Use this on only on hosts you can trust because as long as you are logged in, your key is shareable)
#   # Look into ProxyCommand as safer alternative 
#   #  This implements a single sing-on allowing you to use the agent on the remove server directly, as if 
#   #   you were on that machine
#   #  Note, AllowAgentForwarding option myst be set to `yes` on the servers sshd config to allow it.
#   ForwardAgent       yes
#   
#   ##
#   # Example (X11 forwarding)
#   # Enable redirection of X11 connections, and the DISPLAY to be set. (yes or no)
#   #  This is used so you can launch gui apps that exist on the server on your local machine
#   # The local client that this setting is being called from, needs X11 system installed, to display the 
#   #  remote systems programs. 
#   # You will also need to make sure your DISPLAY number matches between the local and remote.
#   ForwardX11         yes           
#
#  ## 
#  # Example (Disable Host Key Checking)
#  # Disables the normal Man in the middle attack checks
#  # only disable if you have a situation that you need to disable this. 
#  #UserKnownHostsFile     /dev/null
#
#
#   # Example (StrictHostKeyChecking)
#   # By default host checks key (yes), set to no temporarily if you have a bunch of hosts to connect to and 
#   #  you dont want to be prompted that your using a new key.
#   #StrictHostKeyChecking  no
#
#
#   # Example (Forwarding a Port) 
#   # Forward a port
#   #LocalForward           3049 hostname:2049
#
