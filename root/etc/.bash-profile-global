# prevents .vimrc config from affecting vi, e.g. if you run crontab -e, it uses vi by default, and the .vimrc defines params that arent available to it. 
# Note, if you run sudo crontab -e, instead of directly from root, you will still get the issue, you need to invoke this .bashrc by running it as sudo -i crontab -e.
