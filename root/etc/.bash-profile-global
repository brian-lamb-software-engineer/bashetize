# .bash_profile extended remote profile configs for multi server use
# Note, since profile, this loads only once, for login shells only, to prepare
# for the command prompt
#
# load color vars.  This is needed on .bashrc where you want to be sourcing a personal color file for it defining the tty with them, 
. ~/etc/.bash-colours

# For the following, use (or choose, during install) the plain config if you want to use your terminal profile colors instead, e.g. mac terminal profile.  Some 
# prefer the bash configuration since it will work on virtually all linux systems. 
#. ~/etc/.bash-my-colors-plain
. ~/etc/.bash-my-colors

# prevents .vimrc config from affecting vi, e.g. if you run crontab -e, it uses vi by default, and the .vimrc defines params that arent available to it. 
# Note, if you run sudo crontab -e, instead of directly from root, you will still get the issue, you need to invoke this .bashrc by running it as sudo -i crontab -e.
