  #note, enabling the 4th screen below, breaks this on 4x3 resolution and or smaller resolutions below 1680w it appears. 
  # So, if you dont see two blue screens on the top two quarters, then just comment out the below split-v section, and its 4th screen
  #To not complicate this, were back on top, lets do screen 4 now, but put it on the top right of the top pane
  split -v

# notes
#-a -A this helps the windows terminal flow into its pane
# -f was intended to help flow, seems also necessary
# -t is a title
# the number is the title number
# running with niceness -10 when applicable, or necessary
# sudo nice elevates, nice sudo doesnt, we need elevated or sudo wouldnt be there.
