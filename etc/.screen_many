# This is a modification of joaopiziani's config file (https://gist.github.com/joaopizani/2718397)
# Major modifications are as follows:
# 1. Added a set of most useful layouts:
#       - 0 — one (the only region)
#       - 1 — two-v (the screen is splitted vertically into two regions)
#       - 2 — two-h (the screen is splitted horizontally into two regions)
#       - 3 — three (three regions — two in the upper part of the screen and one underneath)
#       - 4 — four (four regions)
# Once selected from within the Screen these layouts are preserved upon detachment until the next
# resuming of the session (due to "layout autosave on" command below). If you've built your own
# layout it must be saved with "layout dump filename" command. Then you can use a code from
# "filename" file to add your layout in #layouts section of this .screenrc to select from.
# 2. By default "two-v" layout is loaded.
# 3. The only window with bash is loaded by default.
# 4. Hotkey code is removed because it doesn't worked for me neither in Ubuntu nor in Centos.
# Any questions and suggestions are welcome to E-mail: oleg@bolden.ru
